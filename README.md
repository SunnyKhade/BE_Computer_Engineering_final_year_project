# 🏘️ Immigrant Accommodation Recommender System

## 📚 Project Overview
This project explores the challenges faced by immigrants—especially students—when relocating to a new city. Using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **K-Means Clustering**, the system identifies optimal localities based on preferences such as distance from target locations, budget, and food availability. The final output includes map-based recommendations leveraging geolocation APIs.

## 🎓 Academic Context
This project was completed as part of the **Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering** program at  
**Padmabhooshan Vasantdada Patil Institute of Technology (PVPIT), Pune**  
**Savitribai Phule Pune University**  
Academic Year: **2021–2022**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, Microsoft Excel
- **APIs:** Foursquare REST API (for location mapping)

## 🔍 Key Features
- 📊 **EDA** to identify meaningful patterns in immigrant preferences
- 📌 **K-Means Clustering** to segment localities based on user input
- 🌐 **Geolocation Integration** for visual mapping of recommended areas
- 📍 **User-focused recommendations** for accommodations near desired locations and amenities

## 🧪 Methodology
1. **Data Collection** from Kaggle datasets
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
3. **EDA** to explore feature relationships
4. **K-Means Clustering** using the Elbow method to determine optimal `k`
5. **REST API Integration** to fetch and map POIs for each cluster
6. **Map-based Output** for user-friendly interpretation

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Use more advanced clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, hierarchical)
- Deploy as a web-based platform for public use
- Integrate real-time listings and user feedback
- Expand applicability to government and NGO use cases for refugee relocation
